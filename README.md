Hello! I'm [@mattsears](https://github.com/mattsears). ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer at heart with a passion for building products that people love to use. In particular, I build web applications with Ruby, which I am very fond of and have been using daily since 2006 and still enjoy just as much today.

My career spans over 20 years of designing and developing complex, large-scale, web applications. My strengths lie not only in the software development and practices of today, but in understanding the complexities of how challenges emerged, and ways in which to manage those challenges in the rapid evolution of today's Web.

I graduated from business school in 2002 with a degree in Management Information Systems. While in college, I built my first e-commerce application for a small book publishing company using Perl, CGI and Mysql. Back then, there were no web frameworks and payment processing over the web was a fairly new concept.

In my junior year of college, I was hired by LexisNexis where I eventually lead a team of software engineers developing a wide range of large-scale, enterprise applications mostly with Java.

In the recent past, I owned and operated a distinguished software consulting firm specializing web application development with in Ruby on Rails. For 14 years I lead teams designing and building web applications that helped our clients reach their goals. I've gained an incredible amount of knowledge on how to run a successful business. In 2020, the company was [acquired](https://mattsears.com/articles/2021/06/30/littlelines-acquired/).

I'm currently residing in Seattle working on my next chapter. My specialties are Ruby on Rails, technical leadership, software architecture, project management, business coaching, product strategy, database design, and mentoring.
