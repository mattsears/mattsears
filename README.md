Hello! I'm [@mattsears](https://github.com/mattsears). ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer at heart and love building products that people love to use. In particular, I am very fond of Ruby, which I've been using daily since 2006 and still enjoy just as much today.

My career spans over 20 years of designing and developing complex, large-scale, web applications. My strengths lie not only in the software development and practices of today, but in understanding the complexities of how challenges emerged, and ways in which to manage those challenges in the rapid evolution of today's Web.

I graduated from business school in 2002 with a degree in Management Information Systems. While in college, I built my first e-commerce application for a small book publishing company using Perl, CGI and Mysql. Back then, there were no frameworks and payment processing over the web was very difficult.

In my junior year of college, I was hired by LexisNexis where I eventually lead a team of software engineers developing a wide range of large-scale, enterprise e-commerce applications mostly with Java.

In the recent past, I owned and ran a software consulting firm specializing in Ruby on Rails where I lead teams designing and building web applications that helped our clients reach their goals. In 2020, the company was [acquired](https://mattsears.com/articles/2021/06/30/littlelines-acquired/).

I'm currently residing in Seattle working on my next company in the e-commerce space that will be launching very soon.
