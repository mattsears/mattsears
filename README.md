I am a creator at heart with a passion for building things that people love. I also love making art - sketching, photography, and designing fills my soul.

Since 1999 I’ve had the privilege of shipping exceptional products to customers around the world. I’ve led teams ranging in size from 1 to 100 at start-ups and fortune 500 companies.

I graduated from business school in 2002 with a degree in Management Information Systems. In my junior year of college, I was hired by LexisNexis where I eventually lead small and large teams shipping a wide range of large-scale enterprise products.

In the recent past, I owned and operated a distinguished consulting firm Littlelines — specializing in shippinng products for small and large companies worldwide. For fourteen years, I lead engineering and design teams shipping hundreds of products for our clients. In 2020, the company was acquired.

Today, I’m the CEO of StaticPop Co., a small portfolio of digital companies I own or have invested in. I'm currently available for investment opportunities, business coaching, product strategy, speaking, and mentoring. If interested, please feel free to reach out.
